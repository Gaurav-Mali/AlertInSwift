# AlertInSwift
App where we created one alert interface like 
1. We created some Views and arranged them in such way that we can create single view
2. Alert pop up is showing whenever we click on to the button

Baically if you are bigginer in ios developement then this is the best practice for making the alert views. 
It is also used in major project where we can add these views. Example - watch and Alert or remainder apps etc

so Keep Going and practicing !!

Wish you all the very best ...!!!!
